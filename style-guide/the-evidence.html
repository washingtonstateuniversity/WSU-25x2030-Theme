							<h2>Propelling the state wine industry to world-class status</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The new, one-of-a-kind Ste. Michelle Wine Estates WSU Wine Science Center is the most recent example of the thriving partnership between the Pacific Northwest wine industry and WSU. It’s a collaboration that has fueled a nearly $5 billion a year state industry—an industry that ranks number two in the nation for wineries and wine production.</p>
						<p>Located in Richland on the WSU Tri-Cities campus—in the heart of the state’s wine country—the facility was dedicated in June 2015. Considered one of the most technologically advanced wine science centers in the world, the facility is expected to become a magnet for attracting world-class researchers and students in addition to fostering economic prosperity.</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>“Every world-renowned wine region has a research university partnering in its success. In Washington, that’s Washington State University.”</p>
							<p>—Ted Baseler, President and CEO<br>
							Ste. Michelle Wine Estates<br>
							Vice Chair, Board of Regents<br>
							Washington State University</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>The Wine Science Center features research laboratories and classrooms, a research and teaching winery, and a two-acre vineyard. It includes meeting space and an open atrium reminiscent of a wine barrel, which contains a library featuring bottles of wine.</p>
						<p><strong>Groundbreaking academic programs</strong></p>
						<p>WSU offers undergraduate and graduate studies in viticulture and enology. The curriculum, the first of its kind in the Pacific Northwest, is science-based and hands-on. The University also offers a bachelor’s degree in wine business management and online certificate programs in viticulture and enology and wine business management.</p>
						<p>Thomas Henick-Kling directs the viticulture and enology program, which has more than 30 faculty members in the Tri-Cities, Prosser, and Pullman. Dr. Henick-Kling worked for 20 years as a wine researcher and educator at Cornell University, where he was instrumental in establishing the undergraduate program in enology and viticulture.</p>

							<h2>A national leader in developing students’ literacy and communication skills</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Washington State University’s Writing Program has ranked among the nation’s Top 20 for more than a decade.</p>
						<p>WSU joined institutions such as Yale, Harvard, and Stanford on the 2016 list of “best writing in the disciplines” programs compiled by <em>U.S. News and World Report</em> for its annual “America’s Best Colleges” rankings. The University remains the only institution from the Northwest on the list.</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>“We have established a tradition of excellence across a variety of services that we offer. We recognize and are always responsive to the changing needs of writers as well as those of the professors who evaluate the work. That’s why other universities follow our lead and adapt our pedagogies for their own programs.”</p>
							<p>—Victor Villanueva<br>
							Director, Writing Program<br>
							Regents Professor and<br>
							Edward R. Meyer Distinguished<br>
							Professor of Liberal Arts</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>The U.S. News ranking is just the latest affirmation of the program’s quality—it began appearing on the magazine’s list in 2001.</p>
						<p><strong>A national role model</strong></p>
						<p>The Writing Program is in its 29th year and remains WSU’s central unit dedicated to promoting critical literacy and helping students and faculty be better communicators. The program’s staff and the All-University Writing Committee work with faculty to develop and review more than 400 WSU writing-intensive courses, known as M-courses. The program also manages the writing portfolio requirement for all juniors, is the center for writing assessments, and provides thousands of hours of writing counseling to undergraduate and graduate students yearly.</p>

							<h2>Raising the bar for veterinary medicine teaching programs</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Washington State University is home to the only college of veterinary medicine in North America to foster and support an active teaching academy. It promotes scholarly teachers and teaching scholarship.</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>“We seek to make our teaching look more like our research, where we are always looking for the next big idea—a place where great ideas and data rule, and where healthy debate and dialogue are the norm.”</p>
							<p>—Steven A. Hines<br>
							Director, College of Veterinary Medicine<br>
							Teaching Academy<br>
							Professor of Veterinary Microbiology<br>
							and Pathology</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>The Teaching Academy anchors the College of Veterinary Medicine’s efforts to improve teaching and student success, including collaborations with the College of Education, reengineering undergraduate courses to promote inquiry-based, active learning, and building a core of life science and health profession education scholars.</p>
						<p>Some of the innovative educational doctor of veterinary medicine programs include:</p>
						<ul>
						<li><strong>Diagnostic Challenges</strong>. Case-based exercises are conducted collaboratively with faculty in pathology, clinical pathology, bacteriology, virology, immunology, and radiology. Visiting veterinarians and WSU alumni of the college return to campus as volunteer case facilitators.</li>
						<li><strong>Clinical and Professional Skills Lab</strong>. Teaches students clinical skills that veterinarians need to practice the best medicine possible. The veterinary clinical communications class simulates real cases using trained actors or volunteers.</li>
						<li><strong>Animal Health Policy Program</strong>. Gives graduate students the opportunity to investigate the impact of science, politics, and beliefs on animal health and food security policy. Students learn about policymaking and implementation at local, national, and international levels.</li>

							<h2>Fostering industry to  develop environmentally friendly jet fuels</h2>
						</header>
						<p class="Intro">Alaska Airlines will fly a demonstration flight in the coming months using 1,000 gallons of alternative biojet fuel being produced by the WSU-led Northwest Advanced Renewables Alliance (NARA).</p>
						<p>NARA is a five-year project supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture that responds to the airline industry’s growing interest in development of a nonfossil-based fuel. The NARA alliance of public universities, government laboratories, and private industry aims to create a sustainable industry for producing carbon-neutral aviation biofuels. The biojet fuel is made from forest residuals, the tree limbs and branches that remain after a forest harvest and sourced in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>“The opportunities for us to build a biofuels industry focused on aviation and, ultimately, marine needs will help us reduce dramatically our reliance on foreign oil.”</p>
							<p>—Tom Vilsack, Secretary<br>
							U.S. Department of Agriculture<br>
							2011, during announcement of a<br>
							five-year, $40 million grant to WSU</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>The NARA effort addresses the urgent national need for a domestic biojet fuel alternative for U.S. commercial and military air fleets. The project focuses on increasing the profitability of wood-based fuels through development of high-value, bio-based coproducts to replace petrochemicals that are used in products such as plastics.</p>
						<p>The NARA alliance includes private industry partners such as Alaska Airlines, Catchlight Energy, Gevo, Inc., Weyerhaeuser, and Cosmos Specialty Fibers, and government and higher education partners such as the National Center for Genome Resources, the University of Washington, the University of Minnesota, Oregon State University, and the U.S. Forest Service.</p>
