							<h2>Addressing the health and well-being of the underserved</h2>
						</header>

											<p>Washington State University’s efforts to serve the health needs of underserved populations took a major step forward in August 2016. That’s when Dedra Buchwald, a professor in the Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine, received a $10 million grant to work with American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities to reduce health risks related to high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Dr. Buchwald will use the grant from the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities to create one of two Transdisciplinary Collaborative Centers for Health Disparities Research on Chronic Disease Prevention. The other center will be at Michigan State University.</p>
<p><strong>Engaging communities, honoring values</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Buchwald and co-investigator Spero Manson, University of Colorado Denver, plan to engage community members at all levels of the research process. All of their study communities experience elevated rates of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and stroke, so the new center will focus on blood pressure control.</p>
<p>The investigators will create new scientific collaborations and enhance existing relationships with health care researchers who work with the underserved populations. The work will promote “scientifically rigorous, culturally informed” investigations that respond to community needs and honor community values.</p>
<p>Dr. Buchwald is the founder and director of the Initiative for Research and Education to Advance Community Health (IREACH), a WSU program dedicated to conducting transdisciplinary research, education, and training to improve the health and well-being of underserved populations in Washington and across the United States. The program moved to WSU Spokane from the University of Washington last year.</p>

							<h2>Making inroads into alcohol and drug addiction</h2>
						</header>

											<p>The Washington State University Program of Excellence in Addictions Research (PEAR) continually makes significant research contributions to the field of alcohol and drug addiction. </p>
<p>Part of the College of Nursing’s expanding research portfolio, PEAR manages some of WSU Spokane’s largest health science projects and is nationally and internationally affiliated with more than 30 investigators. The transdisciplinary addiction science program ranges in disciplinary representation from health policy and economics to experimental pharmacotherapeutics and human toxicology.</p>
<p>Founded in 2006 by John Roll, an internationally recognized expert in the field of drug and alcohol abuse, PEAR advances innovative, scientifically rigorous approaches to understanding, treatment, and prevention of addictions. Celestina Barbosa-Leiker currently directs the program.</p>
<p>One of PEAR’s most far-reaching efforts to date is the creation of the Collaborative Action Toward Community Health (CATCH). CATCH supports research and training aimed at treating mental health and substance abuse in rural American Indian communities. It was established by WSU and the University of Washington in 2012 with funding from the National Institute on Minority Health Disparities (NIMHD), an organization supporting research addressing the elimination of health disparities and the improvement of minority health.</p>
<p>Dr. Roll’s work has focused on human behavior pharmacology, the development and refinement of behavioral interventions for addiction and other psychiatric disorders, as well as technology transfer issues. His research has been funded by NIH, DOJ, BJA, CDC, SAMHSA, and the state of Washington’s Life Sciences Discovery Fund.</p>

							<h2>Promoting global health security</h2>
						</header>

											<p>Washington State University is playing a vital role in the World Health Organization’s effort to eradicate human rabies from the planet by 2030.</p>
<p>Rabies is the deadliest zoonotic disease—those diseases that pass from animals to humans—on the planet. Each year more than 59,000 people die from rabies, almost exclusively from dog bites. The deaths occur mostly in Africa, India, and other parts of Asia, where 99 percent of rabies cases are found.</p>
<p>The disease is easily preventable in dogs by vaccinating them regularly. Once rabies symptoms appear in a human, the disease is always fatal.</p>
<p>To achieve its goal, WHO is teaming up with several international organizations, including the Global Alliance for the Control of Rabies, of which WSU’s Paul G. Allen School for Global Animal Health is a member.</p>
<p><strong>On the Serengeti</strong></p>
<p>WSU scientists work with inter-national partners in a vaccination zone in and around the Serengeti National Park in northern Tanzania. Because research has indicated that vaccinating 70 percent of the dogs in a population will reduce the number of human cases to zero, the University rabies team vaccinates hundreds of dogs each day. The team visits 180 villages each year.</p>
<p>Since the rabies project began, the human incidence of rabies in the vaccination zone has been reduced to zero. Now the goal is to replicate the approach in other parts of Africa and Asia.</p>

							<h2>Fostering industry to develop environmentally friendly jet fuels</h2>
						</header>

											<p>Alaska Airlines will fly a demonstration flight in the coming months using 1,000 gallons of alternative biofuel being produced by the WSU-led Northwest Advanced Renewables Alliance (NARA).</p>
<p>NARA is a five-year project supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture that responds to the airline industry’s growing interest in development of a non-fossil fuel. The NARA alliance of public universities, government laboratories, and private industry aims to create a sustainable industry for producing carbon-neutral aviation biofuels. The fuel is made from forest residuals, the tree limbs and branches that remain after a forest harvest.</p>

							<h2>Making packaged food safer, more nutritious, and delicious</h2>
						</header>

											<p>Juming Tang is finding new ways to make our food safer. In fact, his microwave-assisted thermal processing technologies could revolutionize food preservation and packaging.</p>
<p>The Regents Professor and Distinguished Chair of Food Engineering has developed new methods of controlling bacteria and viruses in “ready-to-eat meals”— frozen, refrigerated, or shelf-stable entrees sold at retail markets and used in institutions, as well as shelf-stable rations fed to military personnel in the field.</p>

							<h2>Addressing food safety and preventing disease</h2>
						</header>

											<p>One of the world’s most cited nanotechnology scientists and his team have developed a portable biosensor that makes it easier to detect harmful bacteria in our food.</p>
<p>Yuehe Lin, professor in the School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering and the Paul G. Allen School for Global Animal Health, led the team that created a simple sensor that can quickly detect food pathogens such as E. coli and salmonella—before widespread food-related illnesses break out. The researchers have filed a patent for the device. In 2015, Dr. Lin was named by Thomson Reuters among the top 1% of cited scientific researchers in the world.</p>

							<h2>Advancing solutions to halt stormwater pollution</h2>
						</header>

											<p>Researchers at the Washington Stormwater Center at WSU’s Research and Extension Center in Puyallup are leading the effort to protect the Puget Sound from stormwater—the number one source of the Sound’s pollution.</p>
<p>John Stark, director of both the extension and stormwater centers, leads the research and outreach efforts. Already, a research project has demonstrated that filtering stormwater using a column of common soil can reverse the toxic effects of urban runoff—saving the lives of young coho salmon and their insect prey.  Other research, involving permeable pavement surfaces and various catchments, is also under way.</p>
