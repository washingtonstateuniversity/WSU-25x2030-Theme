								<h2>Fostering industry to  develop environmentally friendly jet fuels</h2>
							</header>
							<p class="Intro">Alaska Airlines will fly a demonstration flight in the coming months using 1,000 gallons of alternative biojet fuel being produced by the WSU-led Northwest Advanced Renewables Alliance (NARA).</p>
							<p>NARA is a five-year project supported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture that responds to the airline industry’s growing interest in development of a nonfossil-based fuel. The NARA alliance of public universities, government laboratories, and private industry aims to create a sustainable industry for producing carbon-neutral aviation biofuels. The biojet fuel is made from forest residuals, the tree limbs and branches that remain after a forest harvest and sourced in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p>“The opportunities for us to build a biofuels industry focused on aviation and, ultimately, marine needs will help us reduce dramatically our reliance on foreign oil.”</p>
								<p>—Tom Vilsack, Secretary<br>
								U.S. Department of Agriculture<br>
								2011, during announcement of a<br>
								five-year, $40 million grant to WSU</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>The NARA effort addresses the urgent national need for a domestic biojet fuel alternative for U.S. commercial and military air fleets. The project focuses on increasing the profitability of wood-based fuels through development of high-value, bio-based coproducts to replace petrochemicals that are used in products such as plastics.</p>
							<p>The NARA alliance includes private industry partners such as Alaska Airlines, Catchlight Energy, Gevo, Inc., Weyerhaeuser, and Cosmos Specialty Fibers, and government and higher education partners such as the National Center for Genome Resources, the University of Washington, the University of Minnesota, Oregon State University, and the U.S. Forest Service.</p>

								<h2>At the forefront of research to unravel the mystery of sleep</h2>
							</header>
							<p>At the internationally recognized Sleep and Performance Research Center (SPRC) on the Health Sciences Spokane campus of Washington State University, basic and applied scientists study sleep and wakefulness to answer critical questions about the effects of reduced and displaced sleep on performance and health.</p>
							<p>The research seeks to understand the neurobiology of sleep and sleep loss and the effect of sleep loss on metabolism, immune function, cognitive performance, and behavior. It aims to find the best ways to ensure adequate, recuperative sleep or mitigate the effects of inadequate sleep.</p>
							<p><strong>Major studies for government and industry</strong></p>
							<p>Interest in sleep research is growing steadily. SPRC investigators have conducted many studies for government agencies and industry, including the National Institutes of Health, branches of the military, NASA, the Department of Justice, the Department of Transportation, and the trucking and airline industries.</p>
							<blockquote><p>“We all value our wakefulness because it’s so important to be able to do a lot of different things, and there is great virtue in that. But there is also great virtue in getting sleep because getting enough sleep makes our wakefulness so much better and more productive.”</p>
							<p>— Hans Van Dongen, Director<br>
							Sleep and Performance Research Center<br>
							Washington State University</p></blockquote>
							<p>Recent work by the SPRC for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration led the Department of Transportation to adopt new federal regulations that extend the rest period for truck drivers working night shifts.</p>
							<p>The SPRC connects research programs on sleep and cognitive performance across seven WSU colleges, including more than a dozen core faculty, nearly as many affiliated faculty, and numerous staff and students.</p>

								<h2>Ensuring a reliable power supply for the nation</h2>
							</header>
							<p>WSU, home to one of the top power engineering programs in the country, leads the nation’s efforts to increase the reliability and efficiency of the “smart grid,” the computer-automated network that distributes electricity nationwide.</p>
							<p>In partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), WSU scientists, including National Academy member Anjan Bose, explore new technologies to advance power grid operation and control, dependability, and security. They seek ways to automate power distribution, integrate renewably generated power, and prevent blackouts. Dr. Bose has consulted for the electric power industry throughout the world and has been an advisor to several governments on grid-related issues.</p>
							<blockquote><p>“To meet the energy challenge and create a 21st century energy economy, we need&nbsp;a 21st century electric grid.”</p>
							<p>—Steven Chu, Secretary<br>
							U.S. Department of Energy, 2009-2013</p></blockquote>
							<p>Under the leadership of Chen-Ching Liu, an international expert in the recovery and cyber security of the power grid, the Energy Systems Innovations Center brings together research faculty, business leaders, and governmental organizations to address the demand for clean, reliable energy. The center consists of some 30 WSU faculty members, more than a third of whom have specialized knowledge in the core areas of power, energy, and computer science.</p>
							<p>The center also collaborates with a wide range of government and industry partners, and its multidisciplinary studies support development of public policy at the state and federal levels.</p>
							<p>Educating tomorrow’s power engineers is a top University priority. Backed by a $2.5 million grant from the Department of Energy, WSU&nbsp;has launched a new online electrical power engineering professional science master’s degree. A National Science Foundation funded Smart Grid Scholarship program provides about 19 scholarships annually. Its goal: to prepare the clean energy and smart grid engineers of tomorrow.</p>

								<h2>Accelerating international engagement and intercultural understanding</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The Office of International Programs leads the global engagement and outreach activities of Washington State University students, staff, faculty, and communities. Its activities advance the University’s land-grant mission and WSU’s priorities in research, education, service, and economic development.</p>
							<blockquote><p>“The essence of intercultural education is the acquisition of empathy—the ability to see the world as others see it, and to allow for the possibility that others may see something we have failed to see, or may see it more accurately.”</p>
							<p>—J. William Fulbright, former Senator<br>
							United States Senate</p></blockquote>
							<p>International Programs also works collaboratively to enrich the global culture on WSU campuses and build worldwide awareness of the University’s strengths. The office provides transformative student experiences and seeks to enable every WSU graduate to excel in a global society through a rich understanding of different cultures.</p>
							<p>In 2015, a record 2,001 international students enrolled at WSU, adding a rich layer of cultural diversity to every campus. International students comprised 6.7 percent of the total student population.</p>
							<p><strong>International research and development portfolio</strong></p>
							<p>International Programs also manages an international research and development portfolio in several Asian and African countries valued at $21.5 million. The office focuses on establishing strategic partnerships with private industry, governments, and educational institutions across the globe.</p>
							<p>In recent months, International Programs has extended WSU’s global reach by helping to establish a dual-master’s degree in engineering with a Swiss university, signing a $5 million research grant with a private Chinese company, and agreeing to a memo of understanding with Pusan National University in South Korea.</p>

								<h2>Launching a new apple variety to unprecedented heights</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Cosmic Crisp<sup>TM</sup> —the new apple with an out-of-this-world name developed by Washington State University tree fruit breeders—is creating huge interest in the state apple industry.</p>
							<p>In fact, orders from growers for Cosmic Crisp apple trees are on pace to reach 4.5 million trees in the first three years following the initial 2017 release. That would make Cosmic Crisp the largest launch of any apple variety ever in the world.</p>
							<blockquote><p>“The whole industry is pleased. It will be one of the major varieties pretty quickly and in&nbsp;10 years it could be the new state apple.”</p>
							<p>—Pete Van Well, President<br>
							Van Well Nursery, East Wenatchee</p></blockquote>
							<p>What’s driving the apple’s popularity? In part, it’s the world-class reputation of WSU’s tree fruit breeding program and the University’s commitment to the state’s tree fruit industry. Working together for more than a century, the partnership has propelled Washington to world leadership in tree fruit production. The apple industry alone boosts the state economy by more than $7.5 billion annually and produces nearly two-thirds of the apples grown in the United States.</p>
							<p><strong>Combines desirable traits</strong></p>
							<p>A cross between an Enterprise and a Honeycrisp, Cosmic Crisp is remarkably crisp, sweet, tangy, and juicy—making it an excellent eating apple. The new variety is also slow to brown when cut and maintains its flavor and texture in storage for more than a year. It should reach store shelves in 2020.</p>
							<p>The fruit is the result of nearly 20 years of research by WSU tree fruit breeders, beginning with Bruce Barritt, at the Tree Fruit Research and Extension Center (TFREC) in Wenatchee. Kate Evans, a pome fruit breeder, has managed the breeding program since 2008. Research at the center focuses on apples, pears, and sweet cherries, although some research is conducted on apricots, peaches, and plums.</p>
