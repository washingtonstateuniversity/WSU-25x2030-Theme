			<p>WSU President Kirk Schulz and Provost Dan Bernardo  are in the midst of hosting 15 town hall meetings in 4 weeks for each college and campus to discuss the Drive to 25 initiative and seek input that will determine the details of the effort.</p>
<p>“We want this to be a community conversation, not just a list of the great things that we’ve heard,&#8221; Schulz said at the first town hall, on Sept. 19. &#8220;I believe firmly that if we do this, we do come to better decision points.”</p>
<p>The president recently indicated that striving to become one of the nation’s top 25 public research universities by 2030 is the overarching goal that will guide institutional decision making for the next several years.</p>
<p>Below is a summary of the presentation the president and provost make at each town hall. Following the summary, you can read the questions asked and the answers provided during the dialogue portion of each of the completed town halls.</p>
<h3>Fundraising</h3>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> One major achievement is our phenomenal growth in private donor support from $98 million in 2010 to a record $167 million in 2015, an increase of 70% in six years. And, this past year, we were at about $130 million in gifts, which is really quite a testimony about our donors and supporters, considering we have been in a presidential transition and we were not in an active campaign.</p>
<p>We’re currently in the planning stage for the next major campaign, which we anticipate will be in the $1.5 to $2 billion range. It’s going to be a heavy lift, but if we’re going to aspire to greatness, philanthropy will be one of the measures we’re going to need to use to get there.</p>
<h3>Enrollment</h3>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> We recently announced a record student enrollment with 30,142 students—up 8.9% compared to five years ago. That includes increases at our Spokane, Vancouver, Tri-Cities, and Everett campuses this fall.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to see strong growth on all our campuses in the future, particularly on the Spokane campus with the opening of our medical college.</p>
<h3>Diversity</h3>
<p><strong>KS: </strong>We also saw strong growth in the diversity of our student body, with a record number of students of color enrolling, growing from 6,252 students systemwide in 2012 to 8,698 in 2016.</p>
<p>If you look at the diversity of Washington’s population, particularly on the west side of the state, we’re seeing those numbers continuing to grow. We have to continue to create a climate at WSU—with faculty, staff and students, as well as resources—making sure this is a great place for students of color to come to school, where they feel supported, and where they can get that degree and go out and do tremendous things.</p>
<h3>Research and development</h3>
<p><strong>KS: </strong>We also have continued to perform as a great research and development enterprise. Our R&amp;D expenditures have continued to grow, hitting $333 million in FY 2015.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that we’ll hit the $400 million threshold in a few years and keep going.</p>
<p>This is a great testimony to those faculty and staff who are investing many hours into these proposals and submitting large projects. It’s a figure that everyone can feel good about, and it’s something we don’t talk nearly enough about.</p>
<h3>Federal research expenditures</h3>
<p><strong>KS: </strong>Another measurement of success that we track is federal research expenditures. Out of about $130 million in federal funding WSU receives, $100 million comes from four agencies: the Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the National Science Foundation.</p>
<h3>Budget</h3>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> WSU’s budget has changed radically over the last seven years. Many of you were here and recall the loss of more than half our state funding—52%. That has changed how we manage the University.</p>
<p>In terms of revenue, we’re now about a $1 billion a year operation, up from around $650 million about a decade ago. So, we are a much bigger organization, with significant increases in tuition and fees as well as grants and contracts.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that there are only two revenue sources that are flexible in terms of spending: state appropriations and tuition and fees. So, only 40% of the entire budget is flexible in terms of being able to apply it for faculty, staff, and core infrastructure and services.</p>
<p>All other portions of budget are allocated to a specific purpose, like grants and contracts, research, dormitories, endowed gifts.</p>
<p>Out of the 40% of revenues that are flexible, 60% of those are derived from tuition and fees. All that to say, we have become a tuition-and-fee-driven university.</p>
<p>Last year, as most of you know, we did the dreaded 5% reallocation exercise. It wasn’t a cut, it was a reallocation. Half of that 5% was used to pay for the lion’s share of the salary increases for faculty and staff. That was literally money that was not provided by the state legislature and that we did not have in the central budget.</p>
<p>So, half of it went back to the units to pay for that increase. Then the other half went into a pool to be used for strategic research allocation, internal grants competition, and a student success grant competition.</p>
<h3>Strategic plan</h3>
<p><strong>DB: </strong>The strategic plan was developed in 2014 and covers 2015-2019. Because it is a dynamic document, it has been modified a bit to include the Drive to 25 initiative.</p>
<p>There are four themes in the strategic plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exceptional research, innovation and creativity</li>
<li>Transformative student experience</li>
<li>Outreach engagement</li>
<li>Institutional effectiveness</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s great is that it dovetails nicely with the Drive to 25 initiative. I’m proud of the Strategic Plan, in that it includes 5 pages of plan and 10 pages dedicated to implementation. Too many plans lay out broad-brush objectives but don’t designate how they will be implemented or measured to determine success.</p>
<p>This plan includes 57 performance metric baselines that will show our progress on these items.</p>
<h3>Top initiatives and priorities</h3>
<p><strong>KS: </strong>WSU’s top initiatives and priorities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drive to Twenty Five</li>
<li>Grand Challenges: strategic research initiative</li>
<li>Student success initiatives</li>
<li>Medical college</li>
<li>High-level administrative searches</li>
<li>Building projects</li>
</ul>
<h3>Drive to Twenty Five</h3>
<p><strong>KS: </strong>The Drive to 25 initiative is designed to propel us toward achieving a rating as a top 25 public research institution by 2030.</p>
<p>As you know the university has a well-articulated strategic plan that was designed with input from faculty, staff, and student involvement. The penultimate goal, however, was a bit vague, generally stating ‘we want to be a bit better than we were before.’</p>
<p>It’s hard to measure that and what I wanted coming in was something that we could measure our progress toward.</p>
<p>To me, a top 25 public research university is generally known as providing a top 25 experience to all its students—undergraduate, graduate, and postdocs.</p>
<p>The dialogue we need to have now is, collectively, what does that need to look like, what are the components of that, and how do we put the resources in place to make that happen.</p>
<p>There are a number of publications in the media that provide ratings of colleges and universities each year, but they don’t do a great job of rating/ranking achievements, as noted in a <em>New York Times </em>editorial this past Sunday.</p>
<p>What we want to do is select 8-10 major metrics that will allow us to measure our success and compare ourselves against our peers and competition. We don’t need to rely <em>on U.S. News and World</em> report to tell us how we are doing.</p>
<p>Are these metrics set? No.</p>
<p>We want engagement and input from faculty, staff, students, alumni, and stakeholders, which can be done through the Drive to 25 website, or email, or a letter. We want people to feel free to make suggestions, criticisms, positive and negative comments. They will all be posted on the website.</p>
<p>It’s important that we have this institutional dialogue.</p>
<h3>Grand Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> Given the strategic plan, Grand Challenges, and Drive to 25 initiative, I believe we are well positioned to realize these goals—certainly better than at any time in the 11 years that I have been here.</p>
<p>The Five Grand Challenges research themes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sustaining health</li>
<li>Sustainable resources</li>
<li>Opportunity and equity</li>
<li>Smart systems</li>
<li>National security</li>
</ul>
<p>This doesn’t mean we won’t have competitive research programs in other challenges, but these represent the top areas where we currently want to be moving.</p>
<p>To help push these initiatives, we took half of the 5% budget reallocation and put it toward these. That’s a $29 million investment in multidisciplinary research and student success projects that have a 5-plus year life.</p>
<h3>Medical college update</h3>
<p><strong>KS: </strong>The medical college is certainly one of the exciting things happening at WSU. The initial accreditation visit occurred in June, and we’re anticipating a decision in late October. We’re anticipating the outcome will be positive, but until we get the final word, we cannot begin recruiting students.</p>
<p>Right now, we’re also initiating a fundraising effort to support the inaugural class of 60 students who will begin class next summer. Our hope is that each of those students would have some form of scholarship support raised privately to assist them with debt reduction.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we’re also hiring faculty, associate deans, clinic partners, clinical faculty, and making sure we have equipment and facilities in place.</p>
<h3>High-level administrative hires</h3>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> We currently have four high-level position searches that are planned or underway.</p>
<p>* Vice president of student affairs</p>
<p>* Vice president of marketing communications</p>
<p>* Vice president of financial and administration (down to last stages)</p>
<p>* Dean of Voiland College of Engineering and Architecture</p>
<p>We’re going to go through a national search for each of these, to ensure we look at and select the best candidates possible. And maybe those candidates are already here.</p>
<p>We hope to have people named to all of these positions and in place by Jan. 1, 2017.</p>
<h3>Building facilities</h3>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> Everyone I talk to says they need improved teaching and research space, and office space, and these (facilities currently under construction) certainly won’t be the last.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chinook Student Center (former Bookie)</li>
<li>Troy Hall renovation</li>
<li>Digital Classroom</li>
<li>Academic Building at North Puget Sound Everett</li>
<li>Elson S. Floyd Cultural Center</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Q &amp; A with Voiland College of Engineering and Architecture (Sept. 20):</h3>
<h3>Drive to 25 metrics, SAT scores, and trust in leadership</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q:</em><em> When you say the Drive to 25, I assume that by 25 you mean the </em>U.S. News and World Report<em> rankings, or are you referring to some other ranking? Also, what are the specific metrics we need to be focusing on to get to the top 25?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> I don’t mean the <em>U.S. News and World Report</em> rankings. There is a series of standard metrics out there that are used by other institutions that include research expenditures, graduation rate, annual giving, and other well-established criteria.</p>
<p>I think institutionally we need to choose what those metrics need to be for WSU. Ultimately, the total number of metrics we select can’t be 20 nor can it be three.</p>
<p>There is a Center for Measuring University Performance at Arizona State University (<a href="https://mup.asu.edu/">https://mup.asu.edu</a>), and all they do is put out a clean data set, so that everybody is reporting information the same way. They’re not a ranking service, but it provides a data set that you can look at online and download.</p>
<p>What we want to do is review that data annually to see where we rank compared to other public research universities, so we can gauge where we are and set a course for how we’re going to move forward.</p>
<p>There is zero interest among members of the senior leadership team about using media rankings like <em>U.S. News and World Report</em>. Interestingly, there was an editorial in the <em>New York Times</em> (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/opinion/sunday/why-college-rankings-are-a-joke.html) this past Sunday regarding how the <em>U.S. News and World Report</em> rankings don’t matter. They used the University of Maryland Baltimore as an example of a school that has done great things with underrepresented minorities in science and engineering, but is ranked low in <em>U.S. News and World Report</em> because of its mission.</p>
<p>I think the important thing is that we have to choose how we want WSU to be evaluated and how we want to evaluate ourselves. Otherwise, we could end up doing all kinds of weird things to try to get higher rankings in<em> U.S. News and World Report,</em> and people might say ‘I don’t like what the University has turned into because it’s being driven by someone else’s rankings and values.’</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> The <em>U.S. News and World Report</em> rankings are not something we aspire to, and they are very stagnant. You will not see universities moving up and down those rankings, it just doesn’t happen because of their methodology. For example, the undergraduate rankings focus partially on SAT scores and acceptance rates, which don’t fit WSU.</p>
<p>I’d encourage people to take a look at some of the other rankings where we do incredibly well and that are more mission specific. For example, recent ranking in <em>Money</em> magazine looked at the value of undergraduate degrees from various institutions.</p>
<p>There also are rankings that look at the social mobility index, which considers the ability of low-income students to move into higher income brackets after graduation, and rankings that look at accessibility. And we’re doing well in all of those.</p>
<p>We need to be careful to not be whipsawed by rankings that don’t align with our goals and core priorities.</p>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> I did an experiment looking at whether anybody in the history of <em>U.S. News and World Report </em>engineering rankings moved substantially. I went back to the first engineering ranking I could find and then looked annually at those rankings for the next 15 years. In the end, I think I found 2 or 3 schools that moved 5 spots. But overall, there essentially was very little movement among those in the top rankings. What that told me was, you could spend a lot of time and effort and essentially not move much.</p>
<p>Granted, you could probably move from 100 to 75 in those rankings, but to try to move above that level becomes really hard.</p>
<p>Ultimately, my conclusion was, you have to give some attention to it because parents do, but we can’t allow it to drive our behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: Regarding our SAT scores. As I look at the Center for Measuring University Performance data, there were only 2 institutions on that list that had lower SAT entering scores than WSU. The SAT scores for our entering students are really abysmal. And that impacts our graduation rate, because if you have a poor incoming pool, you have a harder time getting them through the system. Is there anything we can do to help increase the quality of our students coming in, so we can have a better retention and graduation rate?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> That is something we have thought a lot about. As most of you know—and I don’t make any bones about it—enrollment management was moved under the Provost’s Office in 2014. The concern we had was that faculty representatives were not at the table when enrollment decisions were being made. In the past 2 years we have made as much progress as I thought would take us five years.</p>
<p>We don’t use SAT scores as our primary criteria, because it is not nearly as good a predictor of success as high school grade point average.</p>
<p>When we go back and looked at the classes that came in 4 and 5years ago, we can see that we were not retaining those students in the low GPA bands.</p>
<p>As a result of the changes that have been made, the 2016 incoming class looks very different. It has a 0.25 higher average grade point average, which is a large difference. But, it still needs to be higher.</p>
<p>We had a waiting list this year of 500 students who would have been admitted 2 years ago, but were not accessed at all to get to our 4,000 freshmen in Pullman. And, we’re recruiting a higher number of high-achieving students. I believe we have about 65% more high-achieving, honors students.</p>
<p>In addition, we’re going to launch an initiative that will package all of our assets aimed at recruiting high-achieving students.</p>
<p>We can do this.</p>
<p>I was involved in the recruiting of several students this year. One of them, for example, was a young lady who was not intending to come here. She had 7 college-level math courses already completed and was headed somewhere else. But we connected her with the math faculty and she decided to enroll at WSU.</p>
<p>It’s going to require a team effort, because recruiting those top-end students is highly competitive. It’s a much different recruiting environment than 10 years ago. Every university from the East Coast is in Seattle with hired recruiters going after Washington state kids because they know it’s a rich environment for high-achieving students.</p>
<p>And while it is not the primary criteria we use, the SAT scores of students will by nature increase as well.</p>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> Please submit those questions and suggestions on the Drive to 25 website (<a href="https://wsu.edu/drive-to-25/feedback">https://wsu.edu/drive-to-25/feedback</a>). I truly want some intense dialogue on this and regarding the types of things we need to be measuring. I would argue that recruiting top students for Voiland College is really critical. Most universities that I have worked at tended to get the brightest and best students, and the engineering programs got the tops of those.</p>
<p>My question is, what can we do to make sure that the engineering experience they get here is really exceptional, with research and other types of value-added experiences that they might not get at other Northwest universities?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q:</em><em> There seems to be a lack of trust in leadership at WSU and in the numbers we’re being told are real. How do you think the university can rebuild that trust?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> Part of the reason I want to use an external group for establishing the metrics and for gathering clean data is that it’s hard to fudge.</p>
<p>If we pick our own internal metrics that we look at each year, then it’s very natural for someone to say, ‘Where did that data come from, and how do we know it’s true?’</p>
<p>If we utilize national norms that have established databases and reporting requirements, it’s much better. That way you or anybody can go online and look at the comparative data and know exactly where WSU stands. I think that builds credibility.</p>
<p>Institutions usually have a higher self-perceived ranking than the data will show. So, using an independent index comes with a little bit of risk, because you might think, ‘Hey, we’re already in the top 25, so why worry about it.’ Then you find out you’re actually number 70. That can be hard.</p>
<p>But, I believe you need to see where you are so you can improve.</p>
<p>As far as the trust issue goes. Trust is something that is earned. I hope that after a year or two you’ll be able to say, ‘I believe what I’m hearing from the administration. They are out there, talking with us, hearing our concerns as faculty, and they are responsive to doing things that we need to do in order to be successful.’</p>

<h3>Q &amp; A with College of Education (Sept. 20):</h3>
<h3>Football, the athletics deficit, the role of teaching in the Drive to 25, measuring progress, graduate enrollment, airport expansion, and expressions of free speech</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q:</em><em> Could you please address the issue of the athletics budget deficit, as well as the current situation with the arrest of multiple members of the football team? There was an article in the newspaper stating that you plan to sit down with the athletic director and coach at the end of this season. I just wonder, is that soon enough?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> Yes, suffice it to say it’s been an interesting week. Allow me to start with the conduct issues.</p>
<p>The University has a clear process in place for any student—athlete or not—involved in an altercation. And there is another process in place that the police use. Sometimes they run in parallel and sometimes they end in different places and at different times.</p>
<p>Do I like reading about WSU student issues like this in the newspaper? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>We want a safe campus where all of our students and student-athletes can come, get together, have a good time, go to class, and we don’t want anybody being hurt doing that. That’s our bottom line.</p>
<p>However, we have to let these processes play out. And whether the news media or the football coach or me as president or anybody else would like to see the process go quicker, the fact of the matter is that we have processes in place and we need to let them play completely out.</p>
<p>I think some of the stuff in the news media over the past week has implied that we ought to just go ahead and make a decision on this student or on that situation without going through the due processes that’s in place.</p>
<p>We are going to let these situations move through the established processes, and then at the end of the season I will sit down session with the athletic director and coach or student life professionals and ask ‘Are the processes that we have in place working? And, are the internal penalties within our athletic programs appropriate and meeting our needs, or are we having serious issues year in and year out that need some addressing in a different form or fashion.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to want to do something right now and produce some favorable headlines, but I’m more interested in establishing long-term solutions that make sense. To do that, we need to pull ourselves out of the heat of the moment and sit down and have a more logical discussion.</p>
<p>I met with the police chief about some of the accusations that were out there. We had a really good discussion, which is important for us to continue.</p>
<p>On the second topic regarding the athletics budget—ideally, I would have much preferred to have entered a situation where the athletic department was a revenue generator. But, that not being the case, one of the things I was tasked with and talked to the regents about is putting together a plan to correct this situation.</p>
<p>Now, it’s not going to be a perfect solution. People won’t like some parts of it, but we’re going to put it together and lay it out there, and it will be fiscally transparent. Generally, it will take about four years to correct the situation, but people will be able to see how we plan to accomplish that goal, and how we’re progressing on a year-by-year basis.</p>
<p>I completely expect there to be pushback over different aspects of that proposed plan, including a possible increase in student fees and things like that.</p>
<p>I’m trying to remind everybody that regarding student fees that there is a clear process that must be followed. The president cannot and should not be able to impose any fee, regardless of whether it is something I like or dislike.</p>
<p>I met with student leadership today and we’re going to let it roll another month or so, and I suspect that in the end we’re going to elect to not even put it (a fee increase proposal) out there for inclusion in a student election.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we’ll put together a solution that’s imperfect and will require some additional adjustments, but we’ll get there. At the end of that process, athletics will begin paying back to the institution some of the debt they’ve accumulated.</p>
<p>Right now, from my perspective, we’re sort of hemorrhaging. So for me, step one is to stop the hemorrhaging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q:</em><em> Regarding the student fee topic, when you say you might not even put it out there for a vote, does that mean that it might happen without a student vote?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> Number one, it cannot happen without a student vote. Second, there is a clear process in which student leadership first has to select what things get put on the ballot for students to vote on. Then, if it’s put on the ballot, it has to receive—I think—51% support of the students who voted. And then, if it is passed, it becomes a recommendation to the regents for approval. So there are all these steps that must be taken, and I can’t wave a wand and make that happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q: <em>There is a lot of emphasis being placed on the Grand Challenges and research in your presentations. But as a land-grant university, part of our mission is teaching. And I’m not seeing any mention of that. Can you talk about your vision for instruction and teaching at the University.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> When we talk about being a top 25 research university, I want us to be top 25 in all that we do.</p>
<p>One of the easiest areas to measure is scholarship, because we can count dollars and publications and things like that. But I want us to also have a top 25 educational experience for our undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
<p>The question is, what does that need to look like? That is an interesting discussion in and of itself, and it is one of the top areas in which our students and alumni can help us.</p>
<p>For example, we’d like to hear from them, if they hypothetically had an infinite amount of money, what one or two things would they change about Washington State University?</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to getting out there and having this dialogue and hearing what they think currently makes, or can make, WSU absolutely unique in a world of public universities that all offer excellent degrees.</p>
<p>In my mind, I think it might include the ability to conduct meaningful groundbreaking research and scholarship at the undergraduate level, or having a life-changing international experience.</p>
<p>When WSU students graduate, we want them to be able to say, not only did I get a great education and degree, but I learned a lot about life and I’m prepared for those next steps and to continue learning.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> We need to define, what the core elements are to creating that transformation experience for students, regardless of what majors or degrees they are pursuing or what campus they are on.</p>
<p>One element of undergraduate programs that we know we are good at, and that we are consistently ranked highly in, is taking students from underrepresented groups—including low income, first generation college students—and helping them graduate and succeed in society. This is about our land-grant mission and our dedication to access and our mission to change lives.</p>
<p>Some programs offer these out-of-classroom experiences, and some don’t. One of the things we need to do is to make sure these transformational experiences are available to all our students.</p>
<p>It’s a matter of faculty, facilities, funding, mission, and providing those developmental experiences both in and out of the classroom, which the president talked about.</p>
<p>We have a plethora of ideas and initiatives for improving and driving student success and student experience, including curriculum, advisors, freshman courses, various tools. Ultimately, however, a lot more needs to be done.</p>
<p>A lot of our focus over the past couple years has been one metric, and that’s freshman to sophomore retention rate. We graduate 67% of the students, but we lose 20% between the first and second year. We do a great job of retaining those students once we get them into the second year. We drove that up about 1.5% this past year, which doesn’t sound like much, but that’s how you get there. And we have a goal of increasing that to 80-85% over the next five years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q:</em><em> Regarding the Drive to 25 indices. How are we doing in terms of growing our graduate student levels?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> Our graduate level enrollment has flattened over the past 3 years. If you look at our graduate level over time, about 5 years ago we had a huge increase in doctoral enrollment, and it was quite intentional. The University put quite a focus on that. But during the same period our graduate student levels decreased.</p>
<p>When looking at the AAU metrics and how we compare to other universities, this is definitely our number one weakness.</p>
<p>The Graduate School does an excellent job in terms of what they do, but we need to increase our enrollment levels. Plus we need to expand those transformative experiences for our graduate students. For example, we need to explore things like: How we can expand their teaching experiences and training so that they are better prepared for careers in the academy? How can we better prepare our graduate students for nonacademy jobs? How do we better prepare them for grant writing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q:</em><em> Can you please talk about where we are today in regards to WSU and the expansion of the Pullman-Moscow Airport?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> I think the airport discussion might have been characterized 4 to 5 months ago as a Taj Mahal vs. a dirt runway debate. But it’s come a long, long way since then.</p>
<p>Olivia Yang, associate vice president of facilities services, has been working hard with the airport board and the mayor to come to some consensus over issues like what we need, what do the dollar costs look like, what structures we need to move and not move.</p>
<p>We had to give Avista right-of-way approval to relocate some power poles and things like that.</p>
<p>I think the reason you haven’t seen much in the media lately is because we’ve been moving ahead quite well.</p>
<p>Reality is, we need that airport and that runway to be exceptional for Washington State University and the Drive to 25. I think we’re impeded in some ways by the current airport, in that during the winter months flights are not as reliable as we’d like or need them to be.</p>
<p>If we’re going to be a high-ranking university, we need air travel and jet service in and out of here on a consistent basis for faculty, staff, students, and our corporate partners. In fact, I would label this a critical factor in the 25 success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q:</em><em> Knowing the number of students that identify as a minority at WSU, what is your take on the fence that will be built (by Trump student supporters) on Terrell Mall in October? The freedom of speech policies here do not prevent this from happening. Does this seem to you to be the best way to represent the opinions of Republican students on campus and the values of WSU in making freshman minorities feel welcome here?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> Dan and myself and Melinda Huskey, who serves as our interim vice president for student affairs and the dean of students, will put a letter out to campus next week that talks about several things.</p>
<p>We believe that regardless of someone’s views, they should be allowed to express them on a college campus and community. I might find someone’s viewpoint abhorrent or disagree or not like their way of communicating it, but I’m a big believer that college campuses have got to be a place where people can express different viewpoints.</p>
<p>That means, at times, we’re going to have somebody or some event that our students, faculty, or staff find objectionable. However, I believe that people have the right to express themselves. I think we’ve got to maintain the freedom of speech.</p>
<p>I would encourage anybody that objects to any of those sorts of things to peacefully demonstrate and express your viewpoint.</p>
<p>Secondly, when it comes to political things, people need to vote. The most powerful thing that somebody can do with a political stance is to register and vote.</p>

<h3>Q &amp; A with Murrow College (Sept. 19):</h3>
<h3>Institutional support for research, the role of students in the Drive to 25, and telling the WSU story effectively</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: How will the University support research at the institutional level? We recently got an email stating that the library system budget had been cut by more than $200,000. And in other realms, all of the faculty here can tell you about difficulties with getting timely responses from the Institutional Review Board. These are issues that are important when we’re trying to maintain and recruit top faculty at a top 25 university level. So, are there plans to address research support in the Drive to 25?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> First, this is exactly the kind of input we need to receive campuswide from you and your colleagues to be successful in the Drive to 25 initiative.</p>
<p>Chris Keane, the vice president for research, has done a massive amount of restructuring in trying to bring resources to bear to help faculty in all disciplines. I would encourage you to continue to visit with him in the future about the types of things you need.</p>
<p>Regarding the immediate library needs, I’ve heard from our faculty saying this is going to have a very serious effect on our ability to conduct research, and that for every top 25 field of research we’re going to need top 25 support resources.</p>
<p>To address this, we’re going to have to take a step back before we take a step forward. We’re going to have to identify the resources we need in specific areas.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, we’re not sitting on big bales of money in the French Administration building, but we have to have a process to address issues like this when they come up, and establish permanent resources to put toward those goals.</p>
<p>That being said, we’re going to have to look at the way we do budgeting institutionally.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we have infrastructure needs that by comparison are going to make the library issue look small. For example, the finance system that WSU currently use was implemented in the 1970s and is woefully out of date. Fixing that is about a $25-$30 million price tag.</p>
<p><strong>DB: </strong>The library has really done a masterful job dealing with increased costs—and please note what they are facing is increases in costs, not budget cuts. There have been dramatic increases in the cost of publications, and we don’t have a way to adequately address those costs.</p>
<p>I will say that in the short run we have been able to identify some one-time money to help us delay this decision by another year. So, we will take that time to make sure that we have a good process in place to make decisions on publications and subscriptions.</p>
<p>The answer can’t be, ‘We just need more.’</p>
<p>What has happened is that we have cut publications to the point that the cuts are really getting deep. Suffice it to say, we have heard that message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: What role will students play in the Drive to 25, besides excelling in the classroom?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> One of the strengths that students bring to the process is indeed that they are bright and articulate and often look at things differently than many of us veteran participants who might have become more jaded. We need your fresh, new ideas and your perspective. You don’t see all the limitations, but rather the possibilities. And, we also need the input of our alumni, who can tell us what made their experiences here great and how we can improve.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> The Drive to 25 is also about having a top 25 undergraduate experience. We need to define what that transformative student experience is. We need to work with you all—whether you’re a Murrow student, or an engineering student, or in Everett, or Pullman—and get your insights into what that looks like, and what makes the WSU experience truly unique.</p>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> Let me add that we need you to encourage your fellow students to be engaged in this. Not just the student senate and a few student leaders, but all of you. And if they say, ‘nah, it doesn’t really matter,’ tell them, ‘yes it does, they’re inviting us and you need to give them your opinions so they can consider them.’</p>
<p>We need you to encourage all your colleagues to log into the Drive to 25 site (<a href="https://wsu.edu/drive-to-25">https://wsu.edu/drive-to-25</a>) and take 10 minutes to give us your insights and opinions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: How would you describe our current situation in terms of reaching a top 25 university position?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> I’m confident that when people review the information in the Drive to 25 packets they will discover a lot of accomplishments that we have already attained.</p>
<p>Position wise, many people already are familiar with our alumni enthusiasm, and our logo and brand, and the Go Cougs! saying. But, there are a multitude of other things I don’t think they are aware of. For example, I found out about the WSU Wine Science Center when I was preparing to be interviewed for the president’s job, and thought ‘Wow, more people ought to know about this.’</p>
<p>As we move ahead, I think we need to ask ourselves how are we promoting and using those areas where we are already leaders and national influencers to our advantage. For example, the upcoming introduction of the Cosmic Crisp apple: maybe we could put a WSU logo tag on each of those apples.</p>
<p>This is a good example of why they don’t want engineers doing marketing, but there’s a multitude of things like that where we need to learn how to creatively tell our story better.</p>
<p>Now, I would rather be in our current situation where we have a lot of great things happening—great research, inventions, accomplishments, education and service—but we’re not telling it very well, rather than find ourselves in the opposite circumstance where we’re attempting to tell it all too well but we really are not doing much.</p>
<p>So, I think we’re in an ideal situation and people are going to be amazed nationally over the next couple years as they learn more and more about the great things we are doing at WSU.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Q &amp; A with non-college affiliated faculty, staff, and students (Sept. 19):</h3>
<h3>Student success, the humanities, funding the Drive to 25, and the roles of development and other campuses</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: In one of the slides I saw a mention of parental involvement for student success. How do you envision that?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>DB</strong>: That is part of a grant proposal that was submitted by both CAHNRS and the College of Arts and Sciences. There is a strategy within the grant to better involve and communicate with parents to encourage student success. At other universities where they have implemented this strategy it has been quite successful in helping to retain students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: Can you talk about the timeline for the search for the dean of CAHNRS?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong> We anticipate launching that search in next few weeks, firming up a search committee and working with a search firm. It’s a very complex college, I can attest to that … it includes about 52 locations. And we’ll be providing opportunities for people both inside and outside the University to provide feedback on what we should be looking for in a dean.</p>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> This applies to all of these position searches. We have an effective search firm and search committees, but if someone in the faculty or staff knows someone who would be a good candidate, we invite them to reach out and make a personal contact and let them know that this would be a great opportunity at WSU. It’s amazing the difference that makes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: When we talk about research at WSU, it’s almost always sciences or engineering, etc. That’s great and we have a lot to be proud of. What I’m concerned about is the arts and humanities are not part of that discussion to the same degree. And my belief is that one of the primary roles of a university is to develop good citizens, as well as job applicants. And the arts and humanities play a very important role in that process. So, I’d like to know how to bring that conversation into the Drive for 25?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>DB: </strong>There are a variety of ways to answer that. The first thing I would suggest is to look at the research planning effort, in which <em>Christopher Keane</em> (vice president for research) went to extreme lengths to engage with the arts, humanities, and social sciences during the 120-day study in 2014. The result is there are themes in our research initiatives where every humanist can definitely become engaged. And there also is a theme that is not at all related to life sciences, physical sciences, or engineering, but around diversity, inclusion, and social justice. These provide a forum in which the arts and humanities can be actively involved.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a pool of money from the reallocation funds that has been set strictly to support engagement from the arts, humanities and social sciences.</p>
<p><strong>KS</strong>: I want us to be good in a multitude of areas, and not really focus on just specific areas. And, if you look at the areas that characterize top 25 public research universities, you’ll see expertise in areas that we already have, both disciplinary tracts and interdisciplinary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q:</em><em> In looking at the Drive for 25, I think we’re all on board. But, how are we going to fund these efforts statewide?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> Ultimately, we have all these great plans but if we don’t have the resources to put behind them to hire faculty and staff, to procure resources, we’re not going to go anywhere.</p>
<p>We have reinstituted a budgeting planning process that many of our deans, department heads, and fiscal officers are involved and engaged in. This is not meant to be a punitive process, as much as we need to know what our academic units need and want to do and what resources need to be available. At the same time, revenues and expenses for all of our units have to match up, whether it’s athletics or anything else.</p>
<p>What we want to do is put some fiscal discipline in place. It doesn’t mean that we’re not willing to take risks, but we have to balance that out.</p>
<p>The second thing is, as we do some more initiatives, institutionally we’re looking at some exciting things involving international initiatives and enhancing international student enrollment, which means we might have to take some dollars and apply them back to some of these institutional things.</p>
<p>Another example is the need to do some IT infrastructure upgrades. This is not an administrative issue, this is a campus system issue.</p>
<p>So, I think we always have to identify what we want to do first, then get strategic about what it’s going to take to allow us to get there, then the dollars have to come. Otherwise, you’re just throwing money at something without thinking about what you’re trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>I don’t want to downplay the money part, because eventually we’ll have to find it. But I think it’s more important that collectively we come together and say this is a goal we want to achieve, and here are a bunch of things that are going to have to happen in order for us to get there, and then it becomes tactical as to how we’re going to generate those funds, whether it is philanthropy, internal reallocation, or increasing Washington state support. We have a lot of those options in play.</p>
<p>Are we in a budget crisis? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>Do we need to be careful about what we do as we move ahead? Yes.</p>
<p>We need to always ask ourselves, what are we going to do, how are we going to pay for it, how are we going to sustain it. Those sorts of things.</p>
<p>And, we have to be comfortable as an institution having those discussions. If we don’t know the answer to all those, it’s okay. But we can’t start 6 projects that are all going to cost a lot of money and say, ‘We don’t know where the money is going to come from, but it’s a great idea, so let’s go do it.’ That’s where we have to have some discipline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: What is the expectation of development regarding the Drive to 25 campaign?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> As we look out ahead a year, we’ll likely have a list of things we need to do, from hiring additional faculty, to adding scholarships and constructing new buildings, etc. Of those, there are certain things that are going to fit philanthropy really well. To me, new buildings or building expansions or renovations fit philanthropy very well. Adding faculty lines probably does not fit philanthropy well, and we’ll need to find other ways of funding that. But, creating endowed chairs or professorships to enhance faculty and research might fit philanthropy.</p>
<p>In my mind, the role of philanthropy is to help us reach our goals on things that make the most sense for our donors and that intersect with our institutional goals. I believe we have lots of room to maneuver when you consider just facilities, endowed professorships, and scholarship support for undergraduate and graduate students. We could easily raise $2 billion dollars for those four things alone and it wouldn’t be enough to do it all.</p>
<p>… We have some givers—every university does—who are more obligatory: ‘I went there to school, it was a great experience, I learned a lot, I wouldn’t be where I am today, so here’s a check.’</p>
<p>I want passionate givers who say ‘Man, I had a great experience, but I love where the institution is going and I want to be part of it, and I want to do whatever I can to help us get there.’</p>
<p>I don’t think we’ve moved to that super-passionate level yet with some of our alumni and donors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: What will be the roles of the regional campuses in the Drive for 25?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>KS:</strong> First, terminology wise, I prefer to say that all WSU has statewide is ‘campuses.’ I don’t want us to use the terms regional or branch. I think they made sense some time ago, but folks, the Vancouver campus has about 3,600 students. That’s larger than stand-alone regional campuses in many states.</p>
<p>Every campus needs to contribute in its own particular way. For example, we have a variety of corporate partnerships with major and small companies. But many of those companies want to work with the campuses from which they hire graduates.</p>
<p>There are a number of large, Fortune 500 companies in the Portland area that might have a better relationship with our Vancouver campus than they do with Pullman. That’s not a problem, that’s a real opportunity for that company to be involved and engaged.</p>
<p>And, from a research standpoint, each campus has its own strengths. For example, our Tri-Cities campus is located next to a billion-dollar research laboratory. And there are unique opportunities that are going to be created through the Wine Science Center there. These are things that probably are not going to happen in Pullman because of location and research specialties.</p>
<p><strong>DB:</strong>  If you look and compare WSU to others peer universities in the top 25, one of the greatest challenges is our size. Think of Ohio State with nearly 65,000 students. We are 30,000-plus with all the campuses added together. It is absolutely critical that we as a system pursue this goal and everybody contribute in the way that is best for them. We will have no chance of attaining that goal as a Pullman-alone effort. It has to be systemwide.</p>
