# WSU 25x2030 Theme

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/washingtonstateuniversity/WSU-25x2030-Theme.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/washingtonstateuniversity/WSU-25x2030-Theme)

## Notes

### Implementing the top section parallax effect.

* The "WSU Spine Section IDs" plugin should be enabled.
* The top section should be a _halves_ section, with only `unbound rebound recto verso` as the _Section Classes_ value and `top` as the _Section Id_.
* The content goes in the first column, which should have `padded` set in the _Column Classes_ field.
* The second column should have `image` in the _Column Classes_ field, and the desired image set as the _Background Image_.
